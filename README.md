# BookChapters
This repo holds chapters, under development for a forthcoming book.		

_Editors:_

+ Eric Bodden <eric.bodden@upb.de>, Paderborn University & Fraunhofer IEM, Germany
+ Laurie Williams <laurie.williams@gmail.com>, NCState, USA
+ Samuel Weber <smweber@andrew.cmu.edu>, Office of Naval Research, USA

## Why This Book?		

At the [Dagstuhl Seminar 23181](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/23181), we discussed a number of topics on the empirical assessment of secure development processes. While we made some progress, we also saw that, clearly, there is still much research to be done. Luckily, in many sessions, we formed a relatively clear picture of what the big open questions are on each topic, the "elephants in the room". With this book, we wish to bring these core challenges to paper, to motivate grad students but also senior researchers to engage on these topics and help address these challenges.
		
## Target Audience		
		
This book is targeted mostly at academic, grad-student level researchers from the fields of Software Engineering, IT Security and Human Factors. Chapters should be accessible to that audience. We should moreover strive to make the book accessible to, and interesting to, industry researchers, too.

## Instructions to Authors

Chapters should use diagrams in gray scale (or no diagrams at all).

Chapters should minimize the use of references (less than half a dozen).

Chapters to be written in Markdown and committed to this repo:

+ To begin that task, send your Githib repo id to any of the above editors. They will add you to the "colloberators" of this repo.
+ If you do not want to hassle with Github, then write in Markdown using on the [free Markdown editors](http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/) and send to the editors.
     
Chapters should be short. As a rough guideline, aim for:

+   250 lines
+   1500 words
+   9000 characters


Chapters should be _approachable_ and raise _challenges_ in the field of research you discuss. Each chapter should serve and answer to the question what kind of research a new grad student could and should engage in if he or she is interested in making a difference in this field.
