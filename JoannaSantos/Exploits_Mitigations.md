# Software Security Mitigation Techniques


***Software exploits*** and **security mitigation techniques** are two intertwined concepts; while the former expose the flaws in your system, the latter remove the weakness from your software system. The purpose of this chapter is to guide you through the open challenges in the area of software mitigation techniques and software exploits.


## Open Challenges for Mitigations
- How can we enforce the correct implementation of security mitigation techniques?
Examples:
	- API misuses (ex: not calling invalidate prior to starting a new session)
	- Coding Mistakes (ex: index <= bufferSize, instead of index < bufferSize)
	- Missing checks when needed (performance reasons)
- Given a vulnerability and mitigation technique, how do we know  the mitigation actually prevents the system from being exploitable? 
- Generating exploits as means to demonstrate a vulnerability (one or more steps that are needed 
- Proof of correctness by showing that the mitigation prevent one of the steps from happening 




## Exploiting Vulnerabilities Automatically
- Given a vulnerability, how can we automatically generate exploits?
Setting up the environment (processor, OS, RAM memory, libraries, â€¦)
- Finding the vulnerability's activation point
- Generating the inputs  to explore the vulnerable path
- Chaining vulnerabilities (each vulnerability is a primitive for a "composite" vulnerability)
- Given a vulnerability, what are the primitives related to the attack?
